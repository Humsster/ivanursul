*A brief description of the content*
Welcome to the blog about *Map* Interface. There will be words about what *Map* represents, as well as its implementations such as *HashMap, TreeMap, LinkedHashMap, EnumMap, WeakHashMap, IdentityHashMap and ConcurrentHashMap*. I hope you enjoy content and gain some new experience.

A *Map* is an Interface that contains set key-value and it has form like this ```Map <K, V>```, where K represents key and V represents value. Keys map values and they are unique, which means that two same keys are not allowed. Also, a keys are objects that are used to retrieve values.

There are three groups of *Map* implementations:
* General-purpose *(HashMap, TreeMap and LinkedHashMap),
* Special-purpose *(EnumMap, WeakHashMap and IdentityHashMap),
* Concurrent implementations *(ConcurrentHashMap)*.
