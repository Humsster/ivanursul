Hi, my name is Ivan Ursul and I am a freelance engineer since 2015. It's been a while since I started my career as an independent freelancer, I started it as an engineer in Upwork, in one of their teams, where I was involved first in reporting backend service, then in the time-tracker pipeline, which is served as a backend for Upwork Tracker Application(UTA) client.

Today I continue my work with Upwork, but I am also actively working with other customers, who are very different. I've successfully completed 22 projects since the very beginning.

That's why I decided to write an article about different aspects of everyday life of a freelance engineer. You may agree or disagree, anyway, I encourage you to leave your thoughts under this article.

This article will be grounded on Upwork platform, I haven't used other platforms, but I am sure the approach is the same.

You will have to find out the common things about your clients. Is all of them are a technical people? Do you prefer to work with non-technical people? What is your industry domain? These are the questions you should answer yourself.

After you realize what combines your customers together, you will easily detect potential customers later.
