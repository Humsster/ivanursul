# 1. List Interface

The Java List Interface represents a collection of elements. What is *characteristic* about List is that same element can occur more than once, also elements in a List have an order and they can be iterated in that order. 

## &nbsp; 1.1 Implementation

The Java.util.List is a child interface of Collection, therefore all methods from Collection can be used in List Interface as well.
