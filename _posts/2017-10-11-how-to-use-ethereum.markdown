One of our clients wanted to create a graphical dashboard for [Ethereum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum) cryptocurrency. This is the second biggest cryptocurrency in the world, at the time of writing this article it costs $301.26 per one ETH. The idea was to write a dashboard for showing all the information from the blockchain network. 

By that time I already had some knowledge of blockchain technology and I wanted to get some introduction project to get more experience for blockchain.

Note, this project has nothing to do with a blockchain itself, it can be treated as blockchain read-only project. The idea was to read the data from Ethereum using GetH API interface, which I will introduce to you a bit later.
