Hi dear reader, my name is Ivan Ursul and I am a freelance engineer since 2015. It's been a while since I started my career as an independent freelancer, I started it as an engineer in Upwork, in one of their teams, where I was involved first in reporting backend service, then in time-tracker pipeline, which is served as a backend for Upwork Tracker Application(UTA) client. Today I continue my work with Upwork, but I am also actively working with other customers, who are very different. That's why I decided to write an article about different aspects of everyday life of freelance engineer. You may agree or disagree, it's normal, that's why I encourage you to leave your thoughts under this article.

### <a href="#different_rates" name="different_rates"><i class="fa fa-link anchor" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> Your rates will differ from project to project

That's a positive and negative aspect. It's positive, because sometimes you will get a job with higher rate, and it's negative, because sometimes you will get a job with lower rates, but this it will be an interesting journey for you. This happen to me when I was writing a [Chicken egg counter on a Raspberry PI](https://ivanursul.com/counting-eggs-in-opencv). It was a fixed price job and the budget was not that big. Anyway, it was an interesting experience, I managed to finish project in time, with a good feedback from customer.


### <a href="#freelancer" name="freelancer"><i class="fa fa-link anchor" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> Being a freelancer doesn't mean you will act as a classical freelancer

The thing is that there are different freelancers. Because I work on Upwork, I know a lot of freelancer from all around the world. Someone is working as a freelancer because he doesn't like burocracy in outsourcing company, somebody likes flexible schedule and enjoys working from different places, somebody has many children and needs to have flexible schedule. Personally, I like the idea that nobody is trying to teach you and you are free to work on any project that you can take.

### <a href="#mix" name="mix"><i class="fa fa-link anchor" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> Freelancer is a mix of engineer, salesman and accountant

My personal opinion is that freelancer should be like a craftsman: he should now where to get clients, how to work with them and should be able to work independently. When you work on a company, you are often supplied with a project, your taxes are paid by company(accountant department) and you have a team of engineers, some of them can often pick your tasks and do them instead of you. When you work alone, without a company, you don't have all this things and you need to provide them for yourself: project should be found somewhere, taxes should be paid by yourself(or by outsourced accountants) and finally, when you don't work - nobody will work instead of you. 

That's sad, but true, this is the reason why lazy people decide not to work on a freelance basis - because it's hard, they think working in a company will insure their stabillity. I worked in a company, and one day customer decided to end his cooperation with us, we were small enough for not being able to find a new client, so one day, 20 people started to search for a new work. The key point that I want to emphasize on is that when projects ends for a freelancer, he just picks a new project, he knows how to get it, even though it's not that professional, as it's done using company engagement department.

### <a href="#8hours" name="8hours"><i class="fa fa-link anchor" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> Usually it's hard to work 8 hours

When you work on a hourly basis, it's usually hard to work 8 hours. At the beginning I felt myself very exhausted. I decided to work 40 hours/week, so my goal was to track 8 hours every day. When you work on a company, you can arrive to the office, go with your coworkers for a cup of coffee, browse your facebook, watch some youtube videos and start your work. Sometimes, you can spend more time on doing nothing than actually doing something useful. In a freelance, you can't you likely waste some time on doing nothing, but that can be easily revealed.

There's also another way. You can find a company, which wants to hire someone from the network to work under their name. In this case, you are not a freelancer, but rather a employee, who works from home.

### <a href="#mix" name="mix"><i class="fa fa-link anchor" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> Learn how to calculate

When I started to work on Upwork, I didn't knew this things. Now I am happy to write them down so anyone who will read this article won't shoot themselves in a foot. 

So, the rocket science of calculating your rate is that you need to calculate how much would you like to earn. Then, you need to take into account, that most probably, you need to have a vacation, which, as you may already know, is not funded by a customer. We have 12 months in a year, and approximately, you will have 1 month of vacation, then you will work 91% of time in a year.

Additionally, you will probably need some sick leaves or days, when you won't be available to work. Let's say, it's 14 days, which is ~4% of your total time in a year.

Summing everything up, you will work 87% of time you can work in a year. 
When deciding how much you should take per hour, remember this number - 87%. 
The bad thing about this is that you will start figuring out numbers by the time your vacation beggins. Then, laying at the beach and taking some drinks, you will realize that you are not earning any money at the moment.

Think twice before deciding how much you'd like to earn.

### <a href="#rethink-time" name="rethink-time"><i class="fa fa-link anchor" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> Mastering your free time

You will have to rethink your free time. For example, when I visit gym, I order food to my office. When I have some things to do, in the morning, I try to work at the evening. There is no rocket science here, and most probably it's the same as working in the company, except that some companies offer to pay for your working day if you've worked more than 6 hours.

### <a href="#calculate" name="calculate"><i class="fa fa-link anchor" aria-hidden="true"></i></a> Calculate your average income per period and ignore monthly payments

Of the things I noticed on the second year of my freelance career. I was a bit confused why I had fewer income during summer. But then I calculated the average number, per month and found that that I have even bigger monthly income, than I thought, because of overwork. Long story short, don't hurry to do a conclusions for one month.
