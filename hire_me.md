### Hiring
You can hire me as a software engineer or consultant for your project. In case you have a small amount of work, you can hire me using [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01773bdc595f0cec47) platform. Alternatively, if you have a big project and don't want to pay rates to Upwork, we can open a direct contract.

### Projects
Here is a list of projects I did and described in my blog:

* [Working with Upwork](https://ivanursul.com/working-with-upwork)
* [How we wrote chicken egg counter on a Raspberry PI](https://ivanursul.com/counting-eggs-in-opencv)

Most of the projects can't be listed here because of NDA, so I described those projects, where I could get an approve.

### Expertise
I am experienced in custom software development, serverless architecture, IOT, blockchain related projects.
