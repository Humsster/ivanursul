### Hiring
You can hire me as a software engineer or consultant for your project. In case you have small amount of work, you can hire me using [Upwork](https://www.upwork.com/freelancers/~01773bdc595f0cec47). Alternatively, if you have a big project don't want to pay percents to Upwork, we can open a direct contract.

Here is a list of projects, which I did and described in my blog:

* [Working with Upwork](https://ivanursul.com/working-with-upwork)
* [How we wrote chicken egg counter on a Raspberry PI](https://ivanursul.com/counting-eggs-in-opencv)
